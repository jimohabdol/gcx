## Quick Start

**gcx** is a unified CLI for managing Grafana resources. It operates in two tiers: (1) a **K8s resource tier** that uses Grafana 12+'s Kubernetes-compatible API via `k8s.io/client-go` for dashboards, folders, and other K8s-native resources, and (2) a **Cloud provider tier** with pluggable providers for Grafana Cloud products (SLO, Synthetic Monitoring, OnCall, Fleet Management, etc.) that use product-specific REST APIs. Built in Go, it uses Cobra for CLI structure.

## Architecture at a Glance

```
CLI Layer (cmd/gcx/)              ← Cobra commands, zero business logic
    ↓
Business Logic (internal/resources/)     ← Resource model, selectors, filters, processors
    ↓                          ↓
K8s Dynamic Client         Provider Adapters (internal/providers/*)
(internal/resources/       ← Pluggable Cloud product providers
 dynamic/)                   (SLO, SM, OnCall, Fleet, KG, Incidents, Alert...)
    ↓                          ↓
Grafana K8s API            Product REST APIs
(/apis endpoint)           (Cloud-specific endpoints)
```

**K8s tier flow**: User input → Selector → Discovery → Filter → Dynamic Client → Grafana API
**Provider tier flow**: User input → Provider CLI → Provider Client → Product REST API

## Key Conventions

- **Options pattern**: Every command uses `opts struct` + `setup(flags)` + `Validate()` + constructor
- **Processor pipeline**: `Processor.Process(*Resource) error` — composable transformations for push/pull
- **errgroup concurrency**: Bounded parallelism (default 10) for all batch I/O operations
- **Folder-before-dashboard**: Push pipeline does topological sort — folders pushed level-by-level before other resources
- **Config = kubectl kubeconfig**: Named contexts with server/auth/namespace, env var overrides
- **Format-agnostic data fetching**: Commands fetch all data regardless of `--output` format; codecs control display, not data acquisition (see Pattern 13 in `docs/architecture/patterns.md`)
- **PromQL via promql-builder**: Use `github.com/grafana/promql-builder/go/promql` for PromQL construction, not string formatting (see Pattern 14 in `docs/architecture/patterns.md`)

## Essential Commands

> **Without devbox**: All `make` targets require `devbox`. If you don't have it, use the direct Go commands instead:
> ```bash
> go build -buildvcs=false -o bin/gcx ./cmd/gcx/   # replaces make build
> go test ./...                                      # replaces make tests
> ```
> Always build to `bin/gcx` (not a temp binary) so the binary stays at a stable path for testing.

```bash
make build       # Build to bin/gcx
make tests       # Run all tests with race detection
make lint        # Run golangci-lint
make all         # lint + tests + build + docs
make docs        # Generate + build all documentation
```

> **Before running quality gates, rebase onto the latest upstream main.**
> This catches conflicts early and ensures `make all` (especially `make docs`)
> runs against the current command tree. If working on a worktree or ephemeral
> branch with uncommitted changes, stash first:
> ```
> git stash --include-untracked
> git fetch origin main && git rebase origin/main
> git stash pop
> ```
> Resolve any conflicts before proceeding. If in doubt about the base branch, ask.

> **Before pushing to a PR branch, always run `make all` with agent mode explicitly disabled.**
> The `make docs` step regenerates `docs/reference/cli/` by running the binary, which
> auto-detects agent mode from env vars like `CLAUDECODE` or `CLAUDE_CODE`. When those
> are set, the binary flips default output formats (e.g. `"json"` instead of `"table"`),
> producing wrong docs. `GCX_AGENT_MODE=false` overrides all detection:
> ```
> GCX_AGENT_MODE=false make all
> ```
> Skipping this causes CI to fail with docs drift.

> **Doc maintenance is a gate before creating a PR or finishing a session.**
> If code changes touch `internal/` or `cmd/` structure, new architectural patterns,
> core abstractions (Resource, Selector, Filter, Discovery), or add a provider:
> run the structural checks in [docs/reference/doc-maintenance.md](docs/reference/doc-maintenance.md)
> and update `CLAUDE.md` (package map), `DESIGN.md` (package table), and relevant
> `docs/architecture/` files. Routine bug fixes, test changes, and small features
> do not need it. Keeping these docs accurate prevents agents from making bad
> assumptions in future sessions.
