## Quick Start

**gcx** is a unified CLI for managing Grafana resources. It operates in two tiers: (1) a **K8s resource tier** that uses Grafana 12+'s Kubernetes-compatible API via `k8s.io/client-go` for dashboards, folders, and other K8s-native resources, and (2) a **Cloud provider tier** with pluggable providers for Grafana Cloud products (SLO, Synthetic Monitoring, OnCall, Fleet Management, etc.) that use product-specific REST APIs. Built in Go, it uses Cobra for CLI structure.

## Architecture at a Glance

```
CLI Layer (cmd/gcx/)              ← Cobra commands, zero business logic
    ↓
Business Logic (internal/resources/)     ← Resource model, selectors, filters, processors
    ↓                          ↓
K8s Dynamic Client         Provider Adapters (internal/providers/*)
(internal/resources/       ← Pluggable Cloud product providers
 dynamic/)                   (SLO, SM, OnCall, Fleet, KG, Incidents, Alert...)
    ↓                          ↓
Grafana K8s API            Product REST APIs
(/apis endpoint)           (Cloud-specific endpoints)
```

**K8s tier flow**: User input → Selector → Discovery → Filter → Dynamic Client → Grafana API
**Provider tier flow**: User input → Provider CLI → Provider Client → Product REST API

## Key Conventions

- **Options pattern**: Every command uses `opts struct` + `setup(flags)` + `Validate()` + constructor
- **Processor pipeline**: `Processor.Process(*Resource) error` — composable transformations for push/pull
- **errgroup concurrency**: Bounded parallelism (default 10) for all batch I/O operations
- **Folder-before-dashboard**: Push pipeline does topological sort — folders pushed level-by-level before other resources
- **Config = kubectl kubeconfig**: Named contexts with server/auth/namespace, env var overrides
- **Format-agnostic data fetching**: Commands fetch all data regardless of `--output` format; codecs control display, not data acquisition (see Pattern 13 in `docs/architecture/patterns.md`)
- **PromQL via promql-builder**: Use `github.com/grafana/promql-builder/go/promql` for PromQL construction, not string formatting (see Pattern 14 in `docs/architecture/patterns.md`)
- **Conventional Commits**: All PR titles (and thus squash-merge commits) must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`. Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`. Scope is optional but encouraged.

## Essential Commands

```bash
make build       # Build to bin/gcx
make tests       # Run all tests with race detection
make lint        # Run golangci-lint
make all         # lint + tests + build + docs
make docs        # Generate + build all documentation
```

> **Before pushing to a PR branch, always run `make all` with agent mode explicitly disabled.**
> The `make docs` step regenerates `docs/reference/cli/` by running the binary, which
> auto-detects agent mode from env vars like `CLAUDECODE` or `CLAUDE_CODE`. When those
> are set, the binary flips default output formats (e.g. `"json"` instead of `"table"`),
> producing wrong docs. `GCX_AGENT_MODE=false` overrides all detection:
> ```
> GCX_AGENT_MODE=false make all
> ```
> Skipping this causes CI to fail with docs drift.

> **Update `docs/architecture/` when a PR changes architecture.** Specifically: adding
> or removing packages under `internal/` or `cmd/`, introducing new architectural
> patterns, changing core abstractions (Resource, Selector, Filter, Discovery),
> or adding a new provider. Routine bug fixes, test changes, and small features
> do not need it. Follow the structural checks in
> [docs/reference/doc-maintenance.md](docs/reference/doc-maintenance.md) to audit
> for staleness — keeping these docs accurate prevents agents from making bad
> assumptions in future sessions.

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd dolt push
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
