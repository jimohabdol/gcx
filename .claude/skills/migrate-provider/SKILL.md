description: Use when porting a Grafana Cloud product from grafana-cloud-cli (gcx) to gcx, when a bead task references gcx provider migration, or when user says "migrate provider", "port from gcx", "port oncall", "port k6". Not for building providers from scratch — use /add-provider for that.

# Migrate Provider from gcx

Port an existing gcx resource client into a gcx provider — core adapter,
schema/example registration, CRUD redirect commands, and ancillary subcommands.

**Before starting:** Read `gcx-provider-recipe.md` front to back.
The recipe is the source of truth for mechanical steps. This skill wraps it
with workflow discipline and orchestration.

**Canonical reference:** `internal/providers/incidents/` — the first full port
(adapter + schema + commands + ancillary). Start there for patterns.

## When to Use

- Porting a gcx resource client to gcx
- A bead task references gcx provider migration
- User says "migrate provider", "port from gcx", "port oncall", "port k6"

**When NOT to use**: Building a provider from scratch for a product without
a gcx client — use `/add-provider` instead.

## Prerequisites

Before invoking this skill, ensure:

1. **gcx binary available** — `gcx --version` must succeed.
2. **Grafana context configured** — `gcx config view` must show a working
   context with server URL and token.
3. **Provider directory exists** — create `internal/providers/{name}` before
   starting the port.
4. **Live API access** — smoke tests (Phase 4) require a real Grafana instance.
   Verify connectivity: `gcx --context=<ctx> resources schemas`.

## Pipeline Overview

```
Phase 0: Requirements Gathering (autonomous)
  → context bundle (source + compliance + pattern ref)
      ↓ [no gate — feeds Phase 1]
Phase 1: Design Discovery (interactive, 1A–1D)
  → ADR in docs/adrs/{provider}/
      ↓ [user approval gate]
Phase 2: Spec Planning
  → spec.md + plan.md + tasks.md
      ↓ [user approval gate]
Phase 3: Build
  → agent team (Core + Commands)
  → code files
      ↓ [mise run all gate]
Phase 4: Verification (4A–4E)
  → mise run all + smoke tests + adapter smoke
  → comparison report + recipe update
      ↓ [user approval gate]
```

| Phase | Agent Strategy | Receives | Produces | Gate |
|-------|---------------|----------|----------|------|
| 0: Requirements | Lead (autonomous) | gcx source + compliance docs | Context bundle | None (feeds Phase 1) |
| 1: Design | Lead (interactive) | Context bundle | ADR | User approves ADR |
| 2: Spec Planning | Lead (or `/plan-spec`) | ADR + context bundle | spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md | User approves spec package |
| 3: Build | Agent team (Core + Commands) or `/build-spec` | Spec package | Provider code | `GCX_AGENT_MODE=false mise run all` passes |
| 4: Verify | Subagent | Comparison report template + spec ACs | Comparison report + recipe update | User approves report |

Phases are **strictly sequential**. Each phase is separated by a gate that
**must pass** before the next phase begins. Gates are not optional.

> **Small-provider shortcut:** For providers with 3 or fewer subcommands,
> Phase 1 stages 1B–1D may be collapsed into a single proposal. Document
> this choice in the ADR.

---

## Phase 0: Requirements Gathering (Autonomous)

Phase 0 is fully autonomous — no user interaction required. The output is a
context bundle, not a design proposal.

### 0.1: Read gcx Source

Read the grafana-cloud-cli source for the target provider. Identify every
subcommand, API endpoint, type definition, and auth mechanism.

### 0.2: Check Compliance Documents

Read the following project compliance documents and record which rules apply
to the target provider. Use the lint compliance checklist from `conventions.md`
as the recording template.

- `CONSTITUTION.md` — CLI grammar, output conventions
- `docs/design/naming.md` — naming conventions
- `docs/design/output.md` — output formats
- `docs/design/exit-codes.md` — exit codes
- `docs/reference/provider-guide.md` — provider interface, adapter wiring
- `docs/reference/provider-discovery-guide.md` — API discovery, design decisions

### 0.3: Identify Pattern Reference

Identify and read the closest existing gcx provider as a pattern reference:
- **Cloud APIs with separate URLs** → `fleet`
- **Plugin APIs (standard Grafana SA token)** → `slo`
- **gRPC-style POST APIs** → `incidents`
- **Token exchange auth** → `k6`
- **Multi-resource providers** → `oncall`
- **Plugin proxy APIs** → `kg`

### 0.4: Produce Context Bundle

The context bundle contains:
1. **Source summary** — every gcx subcommand mapped with proposed gcx equivalent or "Deferred" with rationale
2. **Compliance notes** — applicable rules per document with section references (filled checklist from 0.2)
3. **Pattern reference** — which existing provider to follow and why

### Phase 0 Gate

> None. Phase 0 feeds directly into Phase 1. The context bundle is an
> internal artifact — it does not require user approval.

---

## Phase 1: Design Discovery (Interactive)

Phase 1 uses progressive disclosure with four stages. Each stage MUST receive
explicit user approval before the next stage begins.

### Stage 1A: CLI UX

Propose a command tree with naming and grammar compliance validated against
CONSTITUTION.md's CLI Grammar section.

Present to user: command tree, verb choices, alias conventions, naming rationale.

**Gate:** User approves Stage 1A before proceeding.

### Stage 1B: Resource Adapters

Specify which resources get TypedCRUD adapters, which remain provider-only
commands, the GVK mapping for each adapter resource, and the verb choice
rationale (list vs show).

Present to user: adapter classification table, GVK mapping, verb rationale.

**Gate:** User approves Stage 1B before proceeding.

### Stage 1C: Auth & Config

Specify ConfigKeys, ConfigLoader usage, environment variable names, and any
GCOM/instance lookup requirements.

Present to user: config key table, env var names, auth flow diagram.

**Gate:** User approves Stage 1C before proceeding.

### Stage 1D: Architecture

Specify package layout, client construction pattern, shared helpers, and the
auth subpackage structure (if the provider uses multiple subpackages).

Present to user: package tree, client pattern, helper inventory.

**Gate:** User approves Stage 1D before proceeding.

> **Small-provider shortcut:** For providers with 3 or fewer subcommands,
> collapse stages 1B–1D into a single combined proposal. All content must
> still be present — only the number of approval rounds is reduced.

### Phase 1 Output: ADR

Write an ADR documenting all design decisions from stages 1A–1D to
`docs/adrs/{provider}/`. The ADR MUST be approved by the user before
proceeding to Phase 2.

### Phase 1 Gate

> **STOP.** Do not begin Phase 2 until:
>
> 1. All four stages (1A–1D) have received explicit user approval
> 2. The ADR exists in `docs/adrs/{provider}/` and is approved by the user
>
> If the user has NOT approved a stage, block and re-present it for feedback.

---

## Phase 2: Spec Planning

Phase 2 produces three documents in spec format:

1. **spec.md** — functional requirements + acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then)
2. **plan.md** — architecture decisions + HTTP client reference section
3. **tasks.md** — dependency graph + waves + per-task deliverables

### plan.md: HTTP Client Reference (MANDATORY)

plan.md MUST include the HTTP client reference section from
`commands-reference.md`. This section contains:
- Endpoint table (method, path, purpose, notes)
- Auth helper signature
- Client construction pattern with exact field names

This prevents response envelope hallucination — the most impactful bug class
discovered during provider migrations.

### tasks.md: Verification Tasks (MANDATORY)

tasks.md MUST include smoke test design as explicit verification tasks. Each
show/list command MUST have a smoke test task entry specifying all four output
formats (json, table, wide, yaml).

### Optional: /plan-spec Integration

When `/plan-spec` is available, Phase 2 SHOULD use it. When `/plan-spec` is
not available, Phase 2 MUST produce the same document format manually.
`/plan-spec` is an optional accelerator, not a dependency.

### Phase 2 Gate

> **STOP.** Do not begin Phase 3 until:
>
> 1. All three documents (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md) exist with YAML
>    frontmatter, FR-NNN numbering, and Given/When/Then acceptance criteria
> 2. plan.md contains the HTTP client reference section
> 3. tasks.md contains smoke test verification tasks for all output formats
> 4. The user has explicitly approved the spec package

---

## Phase 3: Build

Phase 3 executes tasks.md waves in order, with `mise run lint` as a checkpoint
between each task.

### Builder Agent Rules

Builder spawn prompts (see `templates/builder-prompts.md`) MUST include:

> "Do NOT infer response envelope shapes. Copy deserialization code verbatim
> from the grafana-cloud-cli source. If the source does
> `json.Unmarshal(body, &slice)`, the new client MUST do the same — never
> wrap in a struct unless the source does."

Builder spawn prompts MUST NOT include verification task details — no smoke
commands, no expected comparison outputs, no pass/fail criteria from the
comparison report template.

### Agent Team Orchestration

The Build phase uses an agent team with two teammates:
- **Build-Core** — owns types, client, adapter, resource_adapter files.
  Must complete before Build-Commands begins.
- **Build-Commands** — owns provider registration and CLI command files.
  Starts only after Build-Core signals completion.

### File Ownership Table

| Recipe Phase | File(s) | Teammate |
|---|---|---|
| Step 2: Types | `internal/providers/{name}/types.go` | Build-Core |
| Step 3: Client | `internal/providers/{name}/client.go`, `client_test.go` | Build-Core |
| Step 4: Adapter + Resource Adapter | `internal/providers/{name}/adapter.go`, `resource_adapter.go` | Build-Core |
| Step 5: Provider registration | `internal/providers/{name}/provider.go` | Build-Commands |
| Step 6: Tests | Command tests (`*_test.go`) | Build-Commands |
| Step 7: Integration / Wiring | `cmd/gcx/providers/{name}/commands.go`, `cmd/gcx/root/command.go` (blank import) | Build-Commands |

Teammates MUST NOT modify files outside their ownership boundary.

### Integration/Wiring Task

The integration task MUST explicitly include:
1. Wire `Commands()` and `TypedRegistrations()`
2. Add blank import in `cmd/gcx/root/command.go`
3. Fix import cycles introduced by subpackage references
4. Fix variable name collisions from package aliasing
5. Run `mise run lint` and fix all new issues

### Optional: /build-spec Integration

When `/build-spec` is available, Phase 3 SHOULD use it. When `/build-spec` is
not available, Phase 3 MUST use the agent team orchestration described above.
`/build-spec` is an optional accelerator, not a dependency.

### Phase 3 Gate

> **STOP.** Do not begin Phase 4 until:
>
> `GCX_AGENT_MODE=false mise run all` exits 0 with no lint errors and all tests
> passing.
>
> Run this command after both Build teammates complete. If it fails, fix the
> root cause before proceeding — do not proceed with a failing build.

---

## Phase 4: Verification (4A–4E)

Phase 4 MUST execute in this exact order. No step may be skipped.

### Step 4A: Build Gate

Run `GCX_AGENT_MODE=false mise run all` and confirm exit 0.

### Step 4B: Smoke Tests (MANDATORY)

Smoke tests are MANDATORY for every show/list command. Each command MUST be
tested with ALL FOUR output formats: `-o json`, `-o table`, `-o wide`,
`-o yaml`.

Smoke tests MUST NOT be marked "optional" or "if live instance available".
If no live instance is available, Phase 4 MUST block and report the blocker
to the user.

```bash
CTX={context-name}

for fmt in json table wide yaml; do
  GCX_AGENT_MODE=false gcx --context=$CTX {resource} list -o $fmt > /dev/null 2>&1 \
    && echo "list $fmt: OK" || echo "list $fmt: FAIL"
done
```

### Step 4C: Adapter Smoke (MANDATORY)

Every TypedCRUD resource MUST be verified via the adapter path:
- `resources schemas` — registration visible
- `resources get {alias}` — envelope + deserialization working

### Step 4D: Spec Compliance

Check every acceptance criterion from spec.md. Report SATISFIED or UNSATISFIED
with file:line evidence.

### Step 4E: Recipe Update (MANDATORY)

Update `gcx-provider-recipe.md` with:
1. **Status tracker entry** — a new row for the ported provider
2. **Gotchas section** — problems discovered during smoke tests (or explicit
   "No new gotchas" if none)
3. **Pattern corrections** — if any recipe step was unclear or incorrect

### Comparison Report

Produce a structured comparison report using `templates/comparison-report.md`.
Present it to the user for review.

### Phase 4 Gate

> **STOP.** Do not declare the migration complete until:
>
> 1. The comparison report has been produced and presented to the user
> 2. Every discrepancy is either justified with written rationale or fixed
> 3. The recipe update (Step 4E) is complete
> 4. The user has explicitly approved the comparison report

## Red Flags — STOP and Check

When you notice any of these during execution, stop and take the corrective
action before continuing.

| Red Flag | Rationalization | STOP. Do this instead |
|---|---|---|
| **Inferring response envelope shapes** instead of copying from gcx source | "The response shape is obvious from the type definition" | Copy deserialization code verbatim from gcx. If gcx does `json.Unmarshal(body, &slice)`, do the same. Never wrap in a struct unless the source does. |
| **Copying gcx client verbatim** — embedding `*grafana.Client`, using `c.Get()`/`c.Post()` | "The gcx client already works, adapting it would just introduce bugs" | Translate to a typed HTTP client (plain `http.Client` + named endpoint methods). Read recipe Step 3. |
| **Skipping the source audit** — jumping to implementation | "I can see the important commands, a full audit is redundant" | Phase 0 is required. Every gcx subcommand must appear in the source summary. |
| **Guessing endpoint names or paths** | "The endpoint pattern is obvious from the resource name" | Read the gcx source for exact paths. Never guess. |
| **Skipping smoke tests** — marking Phase 4 complete without running commands | "The unit tests pass, so the implementation is correct" | Smoke tests are mandatory. Block and tell the user if no live instance is available. |
| **Builder reading verification tasks** — checking smoke commands during Phase 3 | "I need to check what smoke tests will run to make sure my code will pass" | Builders receive spec + plan + implementation tasks. Not verification tasks. |
| **Build-Commands starting before Build-Core completes** | "I can start on the command structure while Core finishes types" | Wait for Build-Core to complete. Commands depend on adapter interfaces. |
| **Skipping a phase gate** | "The previous phase was straightforward, I can proceed" | Every gate must be passed. No exceptions. |
| **Producing custom artifact formats** instead of spec documents | "A parity table is simpler than a full spec" | Use spec document format (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md). No custom artifacts. |
