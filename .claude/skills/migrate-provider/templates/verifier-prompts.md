# Verifier Spawn Prompt Template

Template for Phase 4 verification agent. The verifier receives the comparison
report template, spec acceptance criteria, and verification tasks — not
implementation details.

---

## Verify Spawn Prompt

```
You are the Verify agent for the {provider} provider migration.

## Your Task

Execute the Phase 4 verification steps and produce a structured comparison report.
You test behavior, not implementation structure. Derive all expected behavior
from the spec acceptance criteria and verification tasks below.

## Step 4A: Build Gate

Run `GCX_AGENT_MODE=false mise run all` and confirm it exits 0 with no lint errors
and all tests passing. If it fails, report the failure and STOP — do not
proceed to smoke tests.

## Step 4B: Smoke Tests (MANDATORY)

Run every show/list command against a live Grafana instance. Each command MUST be
tested with ALL FOUR output formats: `-o json`, `-o table`, `-o wide`, `-o yaml`.

Smoke tests are MANDATORY. If no live instance is available, STOP and report
the blocker to the user. Do NOT skip smoke tests or mark them "optional".

```bash
CTX={context-name}

# Per-command smoke (repeat for EVERY show/list command):
for fmt in json table wide yaml; do
  GCX_AGENT_MODE=false gcx --context=$CTX {resource} list -o $fmt > /dev/null 2>&1 \
    && echo "list $fmt: OK" || echo "list $fmt: FAIL"
  GCX_AGENT_MODE=false gcx --context=$CTX {resource} get {id} -o $fmt > /dev/null 2>&1 \
    && echo "get $fmt: OK" || echo "get $fmt: FAIL"
done
```

## Step 4C: Adapter Smoke (MANDATORY)

Every TypedCRUD resource MUST be verified via the adapter path:

```bash
# Registration visible:
gcx --context=$CTX resources schemas -o json | jq 'to_entries[] | select(.key | test("{group}"))'

# Envelope + deserialization:
gcx --context=$CTX resources get {alias} -o json | head -5
gcx --context=$CTX resources get {alias}/{id} -o json | head -5
```

## Step 4D: Spec Compliance

Check every acceptance criterion from spec.md with file:line evidence.
Check every negative constraint. Report SATISFIED or UNSATISFIED for each.

## Step 4E: Recipe Update (MANDATORY)

You MUST update `gcx-provider-recipe.md` before completing:

1. **Status tracker entry** — add a row for the ported provider in the Provider
   Status Tracker table. Required even if no issues found.
2. **Gotchas section** — record any problems discovered during smoke tests.
   Write "No new gotchas" explicitly if none found.
3. **Pattern corrections** — if any recipe step was unclear or incorrect,
   fix it. Document what you changed and why.

## Deliverables

1. **Comparison report** — fill in the template from `templates/comparison-report.md`
   and present it to the user. Every section is mandatory.
2. **Recipe update** — the three items from Step 4E above.

## Verification Tasks

{paste verification task excerpts from tasks.md here}

## Completion

Present the comparison report to the user. The user MUST review and approve
the report before the migration is declared complete. Do not declare completion
without user approval.
