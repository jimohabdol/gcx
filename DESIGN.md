# Design: gcx

## Vision

kubectl-style CLI for managing Grafana 12+ resources via its Kubernetes-compatible API.
Built in Go (~14k LOC), uses `k8s.io/client-go` and Cobra. Enables managing dashboards,
folders, alert rules, SLOs, synthetic monitoring checks, and datasource queries from
a single tool with multi-environment context support.

## Pipeline

```
CLI Layer (cmd/gcx/)          -- Cobra commands, zero business logic
    |
    v
Business Logic (internal/resources/) -- Resource model, selectors, filters, processors
    |
    v
Client Layer (internal/resources/dynamic/) -- k8s dynamic client wrapper
    |
    v
Grafana REST API (/apis endpoint)    -- K8s-compatible API (Grafana 12+)
```

**Core flow:** User input --> Selector (partial) --> Discovery --> Filter (resolved) --> Dynamic Client --> Grafana API

### Extension Pipelines

```
Provider System (internal/providers/)     -- 9 providers (SLO, Synth, OnCall,
    |                                        Fleet, K6, KG, Incidents, Alert, Adaptive)
    |                                        TypedRegistrations() → adapter.Register()
    v
Grafana REST API (/api endpoint)          -- Product-specific REST endpoints

Query Layer (internal/query/)             -- Prometheus, Loki, Pyroscope, Tempo
    |                                        (direct HTTP, no k8s machinery)
    v
Datasource HTTP APIs                      -- PromQL, LogQL, profile, trace queries
```
