# Architecture and Design Decisions

## Pipeline Architecture

The rewritten SKILL.md replaces the current flat 5-phase structure with a 3-stage pipeline enforced by sealed envelopes and agent session isolation.

```
                          SKILL.md (orchestration document)

                     +--------------+--------------+
                     |                             |
              Unchanged files                 Rewritten file

          commands-reference.md,
          provider-migration-recipe.md
          mechanical steps)

## Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| SKILL.md is a single self-contained markdown file with all three stages, envelopes, tables, and checklists inline | Agents read one file; no cross-file navigation needed for orchestration. Matches FR-001, FR-013, FR-014, FR-015, FR-016, FR-024. |
| Artifact format templates are embedded in SKILL.md as fenced code blocks, not separate files | Agents copy-paste templates inline during execution. Separate template files would require reading additional paths and risk desynchronization. Supports FR-003, FR-004, FR-005, FR-010. |
| Sealed envelope sections use a consistent structure: Description, Receives (bulleted), Produces (bulleted), Enforcement (how isolation works) | Uniform format makes it unambiguous for agents. Directly implements FR-016. |
| Build teammate spawn prompt templates are written out verbatim in SKILL.md | The lead orchestrator copies the prompt template and fills in provider-specific values. No room for interpretation about what to include. Implements FR-020. |
| Red Flags table preserved and expanded from current SKILL.md | Current table has 10 entries; new table retains relevant entries and adds entries specific to the 3-stage model (e.g., reading files outside spawn prompt). Implements FR-015. |
| File ownership table maps recipe phases (1-6) to teammates | Each recipe phase produces specific files; mapping phase-to-teammate makes ownership unambiguous. Implements FR-019, FR-024. |
| Recipe update is minimal: add a "Skill Structure" section referencing the 3-stage model, update status tracker format | Mechanical steps (Steps 1-8) remain untouched per spec Out of Scope. FR-011 is satisfied by the Verify stage updating gotchas/status inline. |
| Small-provider escape hatch documented in orchestration table footnote | Risk mitigation for providers with 1-2 subcommands where team overhead is not justified. Referenced in Risks section of spec. |
| Audit stage may delegate research to subagents while keeping the gate inline | The lead must run the user approval gate (only the lead can call AskUserQuestion), but cloud CLI source exploration and artifact drafting can be delegated to Explore/Plan subagents. The lead reviews subagent outputs, assembles final artifacts, and runs the gate. This keeps FR-017 satisfied (Audit in main context) while reducing lead context consumption. |

## Compatibility

**Unchanged:**
- `provider-migration-recipe.md` mechanical steps (Steps 1-8) -- referenced by the Build stage but not modified
- `conventions.md` -- Go conventions document, unchanged
- `commands-reference.md` -- command patterns document, unchanged
- `/add-provider` skill -- separate skill, no changes

**Updated:**
- `SKILL.md` -- fully rewritten (the core deliverable)
- `provider-migration-recipe.md` -- minor additions only: a "Skill Structure" cross-reference note near the top, and the status tracker format remains compatible with existing entries

**Newly available:**
- Sealed envelope model with explicit receives/produces per stage
- Agent team orchestration pattern for Build with file ownership boundaries
- Artifact format templates (parity table, arch mapping, verification plan, comparison report) embedded in SKILL.md
