# SLO and Synthetic Monitoring Agent Skills

## Problem Statement

Operators using gcx through Claude Code agents lack guided workflows for two key observability domains: SLO monitoring and Synthetic Monitoring. Without skills, agents must discover commands ad-hoc, miss diagnostic steps, produce inconsistent output, and fail to route between related workflows (status check vs. investigation vs. management vs. optimization).

The SLO provider (`gcx slo`) has `definitions` and `reports` subcommands with `status`, `timeline`, `list`, `get`, `push`, `pull`, and `delete` operations. The Synthetic Monitoring provider (`gcx synth`) has `checks` and `probes` subcommands with equivalent operations. Both providers support Prometheus metric queries via `gcx query`. No agent skills exist for either domain today.

The current workaround is for agents to read CLAUDE.md, guess which commands to run, and produce ad-hoc analysis without structured failure mode classification or cross-skill routing. For SLO management, users must manually construct YAML definitions from scratch with no guided workflow.

## Scope

### In Scope

- **slo-manage**: Skill for creating, updating, pulling, pushing, and deleting SLO definitions (query type selection, YAML template generation, dry-run validation, push)
- **slo-check-status**: Skill for SLO health overview (list all SLOs, status with SLI/budget/burn rate, optional timeline)
- **slo-investigate**: Skill for deep-dive investigation of breaching/alerting SLOs (definition retrieval, raw metric queries, dimensional breakdown, alert rule correlation, runbook fetching)
- **slo-optimize**: Skill for SLO timeline performance analysis and improvement recommendations (trend analysis, degradation pattern detection, objective tuning advisory, alerting sensitivity review)
- **synth-check-status**: Skill for viewing Synthetic Monitoring check health (list, status, timeline)
- **synth-investigate-check**: Skill for diagnosing SM check failures (triage, per-probe breakdown, failure mode classification, PromQL deep-dive)
- **synth-manage-checks**: Skill for creating, updating, pulling, pushing, and deleting SM checks (YAML templates, probe selection, GitOps workflows)
- SKILL.md files with YAML frontmatter, Core Principles, workflow steps, output format templates, and error handling sections
- Reference files for slo-manage (slo-templates.md), slo-investigate (slo-promql-patterns.md), synth-investigate-check (failure-modes.md, sm-promql-patterns.md), and synth-manage-checks (check-types.md)
- Cross-skill negative routing in skill descriptions
- Shared conventions: agent mode awareness, datasource UID resolution, `-o json` for agent processing vs. default table/graph for user display
- **Standardize time range flags on `--from`/`--to`**: Small code change to add `--from`/`--to` to SLO timeline (currently `--start`/`--end`) and SM timeline. All timeline commands also support `--window` as a convenience shorthand (`--window 1h` = `--from now-1h --to now`). SLO timeline gains `--window` (new), SM timeline keeps `--window` (existing). Old `--start`/`--end` flags remain as deprecated aliases.

### Out of Scope

- **New gcx CLI commands beyond flag standardization**: This spec covers agent skills (SKILL.md files) and the flag standardization code change, not other Go code changes. The investigation log identifies gaps (e.g., `slo status <uid>` shortcut, SLO-to-alert-rule mapping) but implementing those commands is separate work.
- **SLO Reports management skill**: Reports (`gcx slo reports`) are a secondary resource type. The slo-check-status skill covers report status as a supporting step, but a dedicated reports management skill is deferred.
- **Probe management skill**: `gcx synth probes list` is a supporting command embedded within other skills, not a standalone workflow.
- **Multi-HTTP, Browser, and Scripted check type YAML examples**: The check-types.md reference file covers HTTP, Ping, DNS, TCP, and Traceroute. Complex check types (MultiHTTP, Browser, Scripted) have undocumented `settings` map structures and are deferred.
- **CLAUDE.md modifications**: The existing CLAUDE.md already documents provider architecture. Skills MUST NOT duplicate that content.
- **Automated SLO objective calculation**: The slo-optimize skill provides advisory recommendations, not automated changes. It MUST NOT modify SLO definitions without explicit user approval.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Chosen | Rationale | Source |
|----------|--------|-----------|--------|
| Number of SLO skills | 4 (manage, check-status, investigate, optimize) | One skill per distinct user intent. Different triggers, workflow shapes, and output modes. Matches the 4 SLO use-cases identified by the user. | User feedback |
| Number of SM skills | 3 (status, investigate, manage) | One skill per distinct user intent. Different triggers, workflow shapes (linear vs. decision-branching), and output modes. | Research report Section 2 |
| Skill naming convention | `slo-manage`, `slo-check-status`, `slo-investigate`, `slo-optimize`, `synth-check-status`, `synth-investigate-check`, `synth-manage-checks` | `slo-` and `synth-` prefixes group skills by domain. Verb-noun pattern follows existing `grafana-investigate-alert`. | Existing skill naming in `.claude/skills/` |
| Allowed tools for slo-manage | `[gcx, Bash, Read, Write, Edit]` | This skill creates and modifies YAML SLO definition files on disk, requiring file tools. | Analogous to synth-manage-checks |
| Allowed tools for slo-check-status | `[gcx, Bash]` | Read-only status queries require no file manipulation. | Existing skill patterns |
| Allowed tools for slo-investigate | `[gcx, Bash]` | Investigation is read-only: queries, status checks, alert rule inspection. | Investigation log |
| Allowed tools for slo-optimize | `[gcx, Bash]` | Optimization analysis is read-only. If the user approves changes, the agent routes to slo-manage. | User feedback |
| Allowed tools for synth-manage-checks | `[gcx, Bash, Read, Write, Edit]` | This skill creates and modifies YAML check definition files on disk, requiring file tools. | Research report Section 5 |
| Output format convention | Default (table/graph) for user display, `-o json` for agent processing | Follows established pattern from `grafana-investigate-alert` skill. Agent mode auto-selects JSON but explicit `-o` flags override. | Research report Section 6 |
| slo-investigate workflow source | Investigation log workflow (definition -> raw metrics -> dimension breakdown -> alert rules -> runbook) | Real-world validated workflow, proven with gcx commands. | Investigation log |
| Query time flags | Standardize on `--from`/`--to` + `--window` convenience shorthand | All timeline commands support `--from`/`--to` (explicit range) and `--window` (convenience: `--window 1h` = `--from now-1h --to now`). SLO timeline gains both (replacing `--start`/`--end`). SM timeline already has `--window`, gains `--from`/`--to`. `gcx query` already has `--from`/`--to`. | User feedback + codebase analysis |
| SLO push semantics | UUID present = update (if exists on server) or create (if not); UUID absent = always create | Matches the `upsertSLO` logic in `commands.go`. Different from SM checks which use numeric vs. non-numeric metadata.name. | Codebase analysis (`commands.go`) |
| slo-optimize scope | Advisory only — recommend changes, never auto-apply | Optimization suggestions (objective tuning, label additions, alerting sensitivity) require human judgment. Agent routes to slo-manage for execution. | User feedback |
| Failure mode reference file | 8 documented failure modes in references/failure-modes.md | Covers target down, regional/CDN, SSL/TLS, DNS, timeout, content/assertion, private probe infra, rate limiting. | Research report Section 4 |

## Functional Requirements

### Shared Requirements

**FR-001**: Each skill MUST have a SKILL.md file with YAML frontmatter containing `name`, `description`, and `allowed-tools` fields.

**FR-002**: Each skill description MUST include negative routing text directing to sibling skills for adjacent use cases (e.g., "For creating or modifying SLOs, use slo-manage instead", "For investigating a breaching SLO, use slo-investigate instead").

**FR-003**: Each skill MUST include a "Core Principles" section containing: (1) use gcx commands, do not call APIs directly; (2) trust the user's expertise; (3) use `-o json` for agent processing, default format for user display; (4) show graphs for time-series data.

**FR-004**: Each skill MUST include an "Error Handling" section with common errors collected at the end of the skill file, not interleaved in workflow steps.

**FR-005**: All skills MUST use `--from`/`--to` as the primary time range flags across all commands (`gcx query`, `gcx slo definitions timeline`, `gcx slo reports timeline`, `gcx synth checks timeline`). Skills MAY use `--window` as a convenience shorthand where appropriate (`--window 1h` is equivalent to `--from now-1h --to now`).

**FR-006**: Skills MUST NOT ask the user for the Prometheus datasource UID unless auto-discovery fails. The resolution order is: flag -> config -> auto-discovery via `gcx datasources list --type prometheus`.

**FR-007**: Skills MUST NOT explain what gcx, SLOs, or Synthetic Monitoring are. The user is assumed to be an experienced operator.

### Flag Standardization (Code Change)

**FR-080**: The SLO definitions timeline command (`internal/providers/slo/definitions/timeline.go`) MUST add `--from` and `--to` flags as the primary time range flags, with `--start` and `--end` retained as deprecated aliases.

**FR-081**: The SLO reports timeline command (`internal/providers/slo/reports/timeline.go`) MUST add `--from` and `--to` flags as the primary time range flags, with `--start` and `--end` retained as deprecated aliases.

**FR-082**: The SLO definitions timeline command MUST add a `--window` convenience flag that sets `--from` to `now-<duration>` and `--to` to `now`. When `--window` is provided, `--from` and `--to` MUST NOT also be required.

**FR-083**: The SLO reports timeline command MUST add a `--window` convenience flag with the same semantics as FR-082.

**FR-084**: The SM checks timeline command (`internal/providers/synth/checks/timeline.go` or equivalent) MUST add `--from` and `--to` flags alongside the existing `--window` flag. When `--from`/`--to` are provided, they MUST take precedence over `--window`.

**FR-085**: When both `--window` and `--from`/`--to` are provided to any timeline command, the command MUST return an error indicating the flags are mutually exclusive.

**FR-086**: The deprecated `--start`/`--end` flags on SLO timeline commands MUST be hidden from help output but continue to function. They MUST be marked with a deprecation notice in the flag description (e.g., `"Deprecated: use --from instead"`).

**FR-087**: Existing tests for SLO timeline commands using `--start`/`--end` MUST continue to pass. New tests MUST be added for `--from`/`--to` and `--window` flags.

### slo-manage

**FR-010**: The slo-manage skill MUST support 4 workflows: create new SLO definition, update existing SLO definition, GitOps sync (pull/push), and delete SLO definitions.

**FR-011**: For creating SLOs, the skill MUST include a decision table for selecting query type based on the user's description: "percentage of successful requests" -> ratio, "raw PromQL expression" -> freeform, "metric above/below threshold" -> threshold.

**FR-012**: The skill MUST provide YAML templates for each query type (freeform, ratio, threshold) using `apiVersion: slo.ext.grafana.app/v1alpha1` and `kind: SLO` with the correct `spec` structure.

**FR-013**: The skill MUST include a `references/slo-templates.md` file containing per-query-type YAML templates with inline comments explaining each field, including: name, description, query (type-specific), objectives (value as 0-1, window), labels, alerting (fastBurn/slowBurn with annotations), destinationDatasource, and folder.

**FR-014**: The skill MUST use `gcx slo definitions push <file> --dry-run` before `gcx slo definitions push <file>` for all create and update operations.

**FR-015**: The skill MUST document SLO push semantics: UUID present means upsert (update if exists on server, create if not); UUID absent means always create. After creation, the server assigns a UUID.

**FR-016**: The skill MUST use `gcx slo definitions pull -d <dir>` for pulling (writes to `<dir>/SLO/<uuid>.yaml`) and `gcx slo definitions delete UUID... [-f]` for deletion.

**FR-017**: The skill MUST include configuration guidance: objective value ranges (0.9 to 0.9999 typical), window options (7d, 14d, 28d, 30d), alerting best practices (fastBurn for pages, slowBurn for tickets), and label conventions.

**FR-018**: The skill MUST resolve the destination datasource UID by running `gcx datasources list --type prometheus` if the user does not specify one.

### slo-check-status

**FR-020**: The slo-check-status skill MUST use `gcx slo definitions list` to show all SLOs with UUID, name, target, window, and status.

**FR-021**: The skill MUST use `gcx slo definitions status` (no UUID) to show SLI, error budget, and health status for all SLOs in a table.

**FR-022**: The skill MUST use `gcx slo definitions status <UUID> -o wide` when the user asks about a specific SLO, to include BURN_RATE, SLI_1H, and SLI_1D columns.

**FR-023**: The skill MUST conditionally show timeline when the user asks about trends or when any SLO shows BREACHING status, using `gcx slo definitions timeline [UUID] --from <start> --to <end>`.

**FR-024**: The skill MUST interpret status values: OK (SLI >= objective), BREACHING (SLI < objective), NODATA (no Prometheus metrics from recording rules), and lifecycle states (Creating, Updating, Deleting, Error).

**FR-025**: The skill MUST support SLO reports status via `gcx slo reports status [UUID]` when the user asks about SLO reports or combined SLO health.

**FR-026**: The skill MUST route to slo-investigate when a specific SLO is BREACHING and the user wants to know why, and route to slo-optimize when the user asks about improvement suggestions.

### slo-investigate

**FR-030**: The slo-investigate skill MUST follow a decision-branching workflow: (1) retrieve SLO definition, (2) check status with `-o wide`, (3) render timeline, (4) extract PromQL queries from definition, (5) run dimensional breakdown queries, (6) search for related alert rules, (7) extract runbook/dashboard URLs from annotations.

**FR-031**: The skill MUST implement early exit: if SLO status is OK, report health metrics and stop. If NODATA, branch to NODATA diagnosis (check destination datasource configuration and recording rule health).

**FR-032**: The skill MUST use `gcx slo definitions get <UUID> -o json` to retrieve the full SLO definition including queries, objectives, alerting config, and annotations.

**FR-033**: When investigating a breaching SLO with a ratio query, the skill MUST extract the success/total metric selectors and groupByLabels from the SLO definition and run `gcx query -d <datasource> -e '<query>' --from now-1h --to now --step 1m` to identify the error dimension (e.g., by cluster, by status code, by endpoint).

**FR-034**: When investigating a breaching SLO with a freeform query, the skill MUST use the raw PromQL expression from the definition and add dimensional breakdown using `by (<label>)` clauses.

**FR-035**: The skill MUST search for SLO-generated alert rules using `gcx alert rules list -o json` filtered by the SLO name pattern (e.g., `jq 'select(.name | test("<slo-name>"; "i"))'`).

**FR-036**: The skill MUST extract runbook and dashboard URLs from SLO annotations and alerting annotations. When a GitHub URL is found and `gh` is available, the skill MUST fetch runbook content using `gh api`.

**FR-037**: The skill MUST classify SLO status into: OK, BREACHING, NODATA, or lifecycle states (Creating, Updating, Deleting, Error).

**FR-038**: The skill MUST include a `references/slo-promql-patterns.md` file containing PromQL patterns for: SLI window metric (`grafana_slo_sli_window`), 1h/1d SLI snapshots (`grafana_slo_sli_1h`, `grafana_slo_sli_1d`), success/total rate metrics (`grafana_slo_success_rate_5m`, `grafana_slo_total_rate_5m`), objective metric (`grafana_slo_objective`), and burn rate computation formula.

**FR-039**: The skill MUST provide a structured output format template for investigation results containing: SLO name, target/window, current SLI, error budget remaining, burn rate, affected dimensions, timeline graph, related alert rule states, runbook link, and recommended next actions.

### slo-optimize

**FR-040**: The slo-optimize skill MUST retrieve the SLO definition and timeline data over a configurable window (default: 28 days, matching common SLO windows).

**FR-041**: The skill MUST use `gcx slo definitions timeline <UUID> --from now-28d --to now` to fetch historical SLI trends.

**FR-042**: The skill MUST use `gcx slo definitions status <UUID> -o wide` to get current SLI, budget, burn rate, and 1h/1d SLI snapshots.

**FR-043**: The skill MUST analyze timeline data to detect degradation patterns: (a) sustained decline (SLI trending downward over 7+ days), (b) periodic dips (recurring pattern at specific times), (c) sudden drops (step-change in SLI), (d) budget exhaustion rate (projecting when budget will reach 0).

**FR-044**: The skill MUST provide advisory recommendations based on analysis, including: (a) objective tuning (e.g., "current SLI averages 99.2% but objective is 99.9% — consider adjusting to 99.5%"), (b) adding groupByLabels for dimensional visibility, (c) alerting sensitivity adjustments (e.g., "burn rate consistently above 2x — consider adding slowBurn alerts if missing"), (d) window adjustments (e.g., "7d window causes frequent breaches from weekend traffic — consider 28d").

**FR-045**: The skill MUST present recommendations as advisory text with supporting data (current values, projected values, historical comparisons). The skill MUST NOT modify SLO definitions directly.

**FR-046**: The skill MUST route to slo-manage if the user approves a recommendation and wants to apply changes.

**FR-047**: The skill MUST query the destination datasource for the raw SLI metrics (`grafana_slo_sli_window`, `grafana_slo_success_rate_5m`, `grafana_slo_total_rate_5m`) to compute trend statistics when timeline data alone is insufficient.

**FR-048**: The skill MUST check whether alerting is configured on the SLO and, if so, evaluate whether the current burn rate patterns suggest the alerting thresholds are appropriately calibrated.

### synth-check-status

**FR-050**: The synth-check-status skill MUST use `gcx synth checks list` to show all checks with ID, JOB, TARGET, and TYPE.

**FR-051**: The skill MUST use `gcx synth checks status [ID]` to show SUCCESS%, STATUS (OK/FAILING/NODATA), and PROBES_UP for all or a specific check.

**FR-052**: The skill MUST conditionally show timeline when the user asks about trends or when status shows FAILING, using `gcx synth checks timeline <ID> --window <window>`.

**FR-053**: The skill MUST interpret status values: OK (success >= 50%) means healthy; FAILING (success < 50%) means more than half of probes failing and suggests investigation; NODATA means no Prometheus data.

**FR-054**: The skill MUST interpret timeline patterns: flat line at 1.0 means healthy; drops to 0.0 means probe-level failures; intermittent spikes to 0 means flapping.

### synth-investigate-check

**FR-060**: The synth-investigate-check skill MUST follow a decision-branching workflow pattern: (1) identify failing check, (2) get check configuration, (3) triage via timeline, (4) conditional per-probe breakdown, (5) conditional deeper metrics, (6) diagnosis and next actions.

**FR-061**: The skill MUST implement early exit: if check status is OK, report health and stop. If NODATA, branch to NODATA diagnosis (check if enabled, check datasource config).

**FR-062**: The skill MUST analyze timeline data to classify failure scope: all probes failing (target/service issue), subset of probes failing (regional/network issue), intermittent failures (flapping/timeout), recent onset (change-related).

**FR-063**: The skill MUST use `gcx synth probes list` to map probe names to regions for geographic failure analysis.

**FR-064**: The skill MUST include a `references/failure-modes.md` file documenting 8 failure modes with columns: Failure Mode, Signals, Likely Cause, Next Action. The 8 modes are: target down, regional/CDN, SSL/TLS, DNS resolution, timeout, content/assertion, private probe infra, rate limiting.

**FR-065**: The skill MUST include a `references/sm-promql-patterns.md` file containing PromQL queries for: success rate over time (`probe_success`), HTTP phase latency breakdown (`probe_http_duration_seconds` by phase), SSL certificate expiry (`probe_ssl_earliest_cert_expiry`), error rates by probe.

**FR-066**: The skill MUST provide a structured output format template containing: check name/target, type, status, success rate, window analyzed, timeline graph, failure pattern classification, affected probes (count and list), onset time/duration, diagnosis text, and numbered next actions.

**FR-067**: When a datasource is available for deeper queries, the skill MUST use `gcx query -d <datasource-uid> -e '<promql>' --from <start> --to <end> --step <step>` with patterns from the sm-promql-patterns.md reference.

### synth-manage-checks

**FR-070**: The synth-manage-checks skill MUST support 4 workflows: create new check, update existing checks, GitOps sync (pull/push), and delete checks.

**FR-071**: For creating checks, the skill MUST include a decision table for selecting check type based on target type and test layer: URL -> HTTP, hostname/IP -> Ping, domain -> DNS, host:port -> TCP, URL with routing -> Traceroute.

**FR-072**: The skill MUST use `gcx synth probes list` to show available probes and recommend selecting a minimum of 3 geographically distributed probes.

**FR-073**: The skill MUST provide a YAML template for check creation using the Kubernetes-compatible resource model with `apiVersion: syntheticmonitoring.ext.grafana.app/v1alpha1`, `kind: Check`, and the correct `spec` structure (job, target, frequency, timeout, enabled, labels, settings, probes, basicMetricsOnly, alertSensitivity).

**FR-074**: The skill MUST use `gcx synth checks push <file> --dry-run` before `gcx synth checks push <file>` for all create and update operations.

**FR-075**: The skill MUST document that push with numeric `metadata.name` means update, non-numeric means create. After creation, the tool updates the local file with the server-assigned ID.

**FR-076**: The skill MUST use `gcx synth checks pull -d <dir>` for pulling and `gcx synth checks delete <ID...>` for deletion (`-f` to skip confirmation).

**FR-077**: The skill MUST include configuration guidance: frequency ranges (critical: 10-60s, standard: 1-5min), timeout (must be < frequency), alertSensitivity levels ("high" = >5%, "medium" = >10%, "low" = >25%), basicMetricsOnly tradeoff.

**FR-078**: The skill MUST include a `references/check-types.md` file containing a decision tree for check type selection and per-type YAML examples for at least HTTP, Ping, DNS, TCP, and Traceroute check types.

  WHEN analysis is complete
  THEN the output MUST include: SLO name, objective/window, analysis period, current SLI statistics (mean, min, max), budget consumption rate, trend classification, and numbered advisory recommendations with supporting data

### synth-check-status

- GIVEN a user asking "are my checks healthy"
  WHEN the synth-check-status skill is triggered
  THEN the agent MUST run `gcx synth checks list` followed by `gcx synth checks status`

- GIVEN a check with status FAILING

  WHEN the synth-check-status skill is triggered
  THEN the agent MUST run `gcx synth checks timeline <ID>` with graph output

### synth-investigate-check

- GIVEN a user asking "why is check X failing"
  WHEN the synth-investigate-check skill is triggered
  THEN the agent MUST execute the full investigation workflow: status check, configuration retrieval, timeline triage, probe breakdown, optional deeper metrics, and diagnosis with next actions

- GIVEN a check with status OK
  WHEN the investigation skill is triggered
  THEN the agent MUST report that the check is healthy with its success rate and stop (early exit)

- GIVEN a check with status NODATA
  WHEN the investigation skill is triggered
  THEN the agent MUST check if the check is enabled and verify datasource configuration before concluding

- GIVEN the synth-manage-checks skill
  WHEN inspected for allowed-tools
  THEN it MUST list `[gcx, Bash, Read, Write, Edit]` (not just `[gcx, Bash]`)

## Negative Constraints

- Skills MUST NOT call Grafana APIs directly (e.g., via `curl` or HTTP libraries). All Grafana interaction MUST go through `gcx` commands.

- Skills MUST NOT explain what gcx is, what SLOs are, or what Synthetic Monitoring is. The user is an experienced operator.

- Skills MUST NOT ask the user for the Prometheus datasource UID as a first step. The skill MUST attempt auto-resolution first and only ask if auto-discovery fails.

- Skills MUST NOT use `--start`/`--end` flags for time ranges. All time-range commands MUST use `--from`/`--to` or `--window` (after the prerequisite code change adds these aliases).

- Skills MUST NOT interleave error handling within workflow steps. Error handling MUST be in a dedicated section at the end of the skill file.

- The slo-manage skill MUST NOT push SLO definition files without running `--dry-run` first.

- The synth-manage-checks skill MUST NOT push check files without running `--dry-run` first.

- The slo-optimize skill MUST NOT modify SLO definitions directly. It MUST present recommendations as advisory text and route to slo-manage for execution.

- Skills MUST NOT duplicate content from CLAUDE.md (e.g., provider architecture, command tree overview).

- Reference files MUST NOT exceed 200 lines each.

- SKILL.md files MUST NOT exceed 400 lines.

## Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| PromQL queries fail due to missing datasource or metrics | Investigation and optimization skills produce NODATA results, reducing diagnostic value | Skills document graceful degradation: report what is available, suggest datasource configuration. FR-006 ensures auto-resolution is attempted first. |
| Complex check types (MultiHTTP, Browser, Scripted) have undocumented settings | synth-manage-checks cannot generate valid YAML for these types | Explicitly scoped out. check-types.md covers 5 standard types. Skill directs users to `pull` an existing check as a template for complex types. |
| SLO recording rule metrics (`grafana_slo_*`) return no data | slo-check-status and slo-investigate show NODATA for all SLOs | Skill documents this as a known state (recording rules may not be evaluating or may write to a different datasource). Suggests checking destination datasource config. |
| Probe names are case-sensitive; mismatch causes push failure | synth-manage-checks push fails with "probe not found" | Skill documents exact case sensitivity requirement. Recommends running `probes list` first and copy-pasting names. |
| Flag alias code change breaks existing scripts using `--start`/`--end` or `--window` | Users relying on old flag names see failures after update | Old flags remain as deprecated aliases, not removed. Only skills use the new `--from`/`--to` names. |
| Investigation log workflow gaps (no `slo status <uid>` shortcut, no SLO-to-alert mapping) | slo-investigate skill uses workarounds (pattern-matching alert rule names, manual PromQL) | Workarounds are documented in the skill. Future CLI improvements will simplify the workflow. |
| slo-optimize recommendations are generic or unhelpful | User loses trust in optimization suggestions | Recommendations MUST include supporting data (actual metric values, computed statistics). The skill provides advisory text, not automated changes, so the user retains judgment. |
| 7 skills create high maintenance burden | Skills drift out of sync with CLI changes | Each skill is self-contained. Cross-skill routing uses skill names, not shared code. Reference files centralize reusable content (templates, PromQL patterns). |
| SLO push upsert semantics differ from SM check push semantics | Agent uses wrong create/update pattern | FR-015 (SLO: UUID-based upsert) and FR-075 (SM: numeric metadata.name) document the distinct semantics per domain. |

## Open Questions

- [RESOLVED] Whether to standardize time range flags: Yes — all commands will support `--from`/`--to` (explicit range) and `--window` (convenience shorthand). SLO timeline gains `--from`/`--to` and `--window` (replacing `--start`/`--end`). SM timeline keeps `--window`, gains `--from`/`--to`. Old `--start`/`--end` flags remain as deprecated aliases. User approved small code changes for this.

- [RESOLVED] Whether synth-check-status and synth-investigate-check should be merged: Research report (Section 2) demonstrates clear trigger separation and different workflow shapes (linear vs. decision-branching). Keeping them separate.

- [RESOLVED] Whether SLO management should be in scope: User feedback explicitly requests 4 SLO use-cases including creation/management. slo-manage skill added with full CRUD support.

- [RESOLVED] How many SLO skills: User feedback specifies 4 distinct intents (manage, check-status, investigate, optimize). Each has different triggers, workflow shapes, and output requirements.

- [DEFERRED] Whether to add a `slo status <uid>` shortcut command: The investigation log identifies this gap. The slo-investigate skill works around it using `gcx slo definitions status <UUID>`. CLI improvement is separate work.

- [DEFERRED] How to handle SLO-to-alert-rule mapping without a dedicated command: The slo-investigate skill uses pattern matching on alert rule names (`gcx alert rules list -o json | jq select(.name | test("<slo-name>"))`). A future `gcx slo alerts <uid>` command would eliminate this workaround.

- [DEFERRED] Whether MultiHTTP, Browser, and Scripted check type examples should be added to check-types.md: Requires testing with real checks to verify undocumented settings map structures. Will iterate after initial skill delivery.

- [DEFERRED] Whether slo-optimize should support cross-SLO correlation analysis (e.g., detecting that multiple SLOs breach simultaneously due to shared infrastructure): Useful but adds significant complexity. Defer to a future iteration after single-SLO optimization is proven.
