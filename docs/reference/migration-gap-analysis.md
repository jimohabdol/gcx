# Migration Gap Analysis: grafana-cloud-cli → gcx

## Context
We are migrating from the old `grafana-cloud-cli` to the new `gcx` codebase. This document catalogs every command, flag, and utility present in the old CLI that is **missing or incomplete** in the new one, to guide migration planning.

---

## 1. Setup & Authentication Commands

### Missing Commands

| Old Command | Description | Status in gcx |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|

| `gcx completion` | Shell completion (bash/zsh/fish/powershell) | **Missing** |
| `gcx version` | Print version | **Missing** (may be a hidden flag) |
| `gcx agent-card` | A2A-compliant agent card generation | **Missing** |
| `gcx commands` | List all commands and schemas (LLM-friendly) | **Missing** |

### Config Differences

| Feature | Old CLI | New gcx |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Config subcommands | `context show/use/list/delete` | `config view/current-context/list-contexts/use-context/set/unset/edit/path/check` |
| Config layers | Single file | System/user/local layers (more advanced) |

**Assessment:** New gcx has a *more sophisticated* config system but is missing the `init` bootstrap flow, auth status, sessions, and dir pinning.

---

## 2. Global Flags

### Missing Global Flags

| Flag | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `--token` | Cloud Access Policy token | gcx uses config contexts instead |
| `--stack` | Target stack slug | gcx uses config contexts |
| `--context` | Config context for this invocation | gcx uses `config use-context` |
| `-o, --output` (global) | Global output format (text/json/yaml/csv/jsonpath) | gcx has per-command `-o` but not global |
| `-q, --quiet` | Suppress decorative output | **Missing** |
| `--field` | Extract single field from output | **Missing** |
| `--dry-run` (global) | Global dry-run mode | gcx has it only on `resources push/delete` |
| `--diff` | Show field-level diff with dry-run | **Missing** |
| `--upsert` | Create-or-update on 409 conflict | **Missing** |
| `--if-not-exists` | Skip silently on 409 | **Missing** |
| `--readonly` | Enforce read-only mode | **Missing** |
| `--gcom-url` | GCOM API base URL | **Missing** as flag (may be in config) |
| `--stack-url` | Grafana stack API URL | **Missing** as flag |
| `--no-audit` | Disable local audit log | **Missing** (gcx has no audit log yet) |
| `--self-observe` | Send CLI traces/metrics to stack | **Missing** |
| `--jq` | Apply jq expression to output | **Missing** |
| `--timeout` | Max command duration | **Missing** |

### New gcx-Only Flags
- `--no-color` - Disable color
- `--no-truncate` - Disable table truncation
- `--agent` - Agent mode (auto-detected)
- `-v` (count-based) - Multiple verbosity levels

## 3. Verb-First (kubectl-style) Commands

### Missing
| Old Command | Description |

## 12. Agentic Discoverability Gap Analysis

The old CLI has a deeply layered system for helping LLM/agent consumers discover capabilities, understand schemas, and choose next actions -- all without needing to read docs. The new gcx has *some* of this, but significant gaps remain.

### What the Old CLI Has (10 Layers of Agentic Metadata)

#### Layer 1: `gcx commands` -- Hierarchical Command Catalog
- Lists every command with rich metadata: `full_path`, `description`, `long`, `example`, `args`, `flags` (with types/defaults), recursive `subcommands`
- Includes **`token_cost`** ("small"/"medium"/"large") so agents can estimate output size before calling
- Includes **`llm_hint`** per command (e.g., `"--since 30m --limit 20"`) -- tells agents how to scope large commands
- Includes **`required_scope`**, **`required_role`**, **`required_action`** -- agents know permissions before calling
- Supports `--flat -o json` for machine parsing
- **gcx status: MISSING**

#### Layer 2: `gcx help-tree` -- Token-Efficient Command Tree
- Compact indented text tree, 2 spaces per level
- Leaf commands show args and flags inline
- Detects enum patterns in flags (e.g., `ignore|fail|abort`)
- Shows `# Tips` and `# hint:` annotations inline
- Supports `--depth` to limit nesting and subtree filtering
- **gcx status: MISSING**

#### Layer 3: `gcx agent-card` -- A2A Agent Card
- Machine-readable JSON describing: name, version, capabilities (dry_run, batch_input, stdin_pipe, json_output), skills (resource groups with actions), authentication schemes (env vars, flags), output modes
- Follows the Agent-to-Agent protocol standard
- Can filter to single skill: `--command dashboards`
- **gcx status: MISSING**

#### Layer 4: `gcx <resource> schema` -- Per-Resource JSON Schema
- Every resource type has a `schema` subcommand outputting full JSON Schema
- Uses Go's `jsonschema` reflection -- always in sync with code
- Schema includes `$defs` with all nested type definitions
- Wrapped in K8s-style manifest envelope (apiVersion, kind, metadata, spec)
- **gcx status: PARTIALLY EXISTS** -- `resources schemas` fetches OpenAPI schemas from server, but:
  - Not per-resource subcommand (centralized only)
  - Provider-backed resources use hand-written schemas in Registration structs
  - No Go type reflection -- schemas are manually maintained JSON blobs

#### Layer 5: `gcx <resource> example` -- Per-Resource Examples
- Every resource type has an `example` subcommand with realistic field values
- Respects `-o` format (json, yaml, text)
- Can include API reference URL
- **gcx status: PARTIALLY EXISTS** -- `resources examples` lists provider examples, but:
  - Not per-resource subcommand (centralized only)
  - Examples are hand-written JSON in provider Registration structs
  - K8s-tier resources don't have examples

#### Layer 6: `gcx explain <resource>[.field.path]` -- Field-Level Docs
- Drills into schema: `gcx explain dashboards.spec.title` shows type + description
- Dereferences `$ref` pointers
- `--recursive` expands all nested objects
- **gcx status: MISSING**

#### Layer 7: Command Annotations (Cobra metadata)
Old CLI annotates every command with structured metadata:

| Annotation | Purpose | gcx Status |
|------------|---------|------------|
| `token_cost` (small/medium/large) | LLM cost estimation before invocation | **MISSING** |
| `llm_hint` | Scoping guidance for large commands | **MISSING** |
| `tips` | Multi-line operational guidance | **MISSING** |
| `required_scope` | Access policy scopes needed | **MISSING** |
| `required_role` | Grafana role needed (Viewer/Editor/Admin) | **MISSING** |
| `required_action` | RBAC action needed | **MISSING** |
| `supports_graph` | Command supports `-o graph` | **MISSING** |

- Enforced via `consistency_test.go`: every executable command MUST have `token_cost`; every "large" command MUST have `llm_hint`
- Permission annotations are centrally managed in `permissions.go` and inherited by child commands

#### Layer 8: Permission-Enriched Error Messages
- On 403 errors, old CLI wraps the error with the command's permission annotations:
  - "Required access policy scope(s): metrics:read"
  - "Hint: add the missing scope(s) to your access policy"
  - "Required Grafana role: Editor"
- Uses `LastCommandAnnotations` global to correlate errors with command metadata
- On unknown commands: `"hint: run 'gcx agent-card -o json' to explore all available commands"`
- **gcx status: PARTIALLY EXISTS** -- `cmd/gcx/fail/` has structured `DetailedError` with `Suggestions` array and `DocsLink`, but no permission-specific enrichment or command annotation correlation

#### Layer 9: `gcx skills install/list` -- Bundled Agent Playbooks
- Ships markdown-based skill files (SKILL.md) with YAML frontmatter
- Installable into different LLM environments: Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot
- Main skill teaches a 4-step discovery protocol:
  1. Inspect tree (`help-tree`)
  2. Inspect commands (`commands --flat`)
  3. Inspect help (specific command `--help`)
  4. Pull examples/schemas
- **gcx status: MISSING** (skills are installed externally via Claude Code config, not bundled in binary)

#### Layer 10: `gcx api-resources` -- Resource Type Registry
- Lists all known resource types with NAME, APIVERSION, KIND
- Quick scan of available surface area
- **gcx status: PARTIALLY EXISTS** -- `resources schemas` covers this but with more ceremony (requires server connection for K8s resources)

### What New gcx Has That Old CLI Doesn't

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **`--json ?` field discovery** | Agents discover queryable fields without docs: `gcx resources get --json ?` |
| **`--json field1,field2` selection** | Select specific fields from JSON output |
| **Agent mode auto-detection** | Detects CLAUDECODE, CURSOR_AGENT, GITHUB_COPILOT env vars; switches to JSON by default |
| **Structured error JSON** | `DetailedError` with `summary`, `details`, `suggestions[]`, `docsLink`, `exitCode` -- machine-parseable |
| **Partial failure envelope** | `{"items": [...], "error": {...}}` when some operations succeed and others fail |
| **Provider self-registration** | Schemas and examples registered at init time via `adapter.Register()` |
| **Progressive disclosure** | `--json ?` -> field list -> `--json field1,field2` -> filtered output |

### Gap Summary Table

| Capability | Old CLI | New gcx | Gap Severity |
|------------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Command catalog with metadata | `commands` (token_cost, llm_hint, permissions) | **Missing** | **HIGH** |
| Token-efficient tree | `help-tree` (depth, subtree, tips) | **Missing** | **HIGH** |
| A2A agent card | `agent-card` (skills, auth, capabilities) | **Missing** | **MEDIUM** |
| Per-resource schema | `<resource> schema` (auto-generated from Go types) | `resources schemas` (centralized, server-fetched) | **LOW** (different approach) |
| Per-resource example | `<resource> example` | `resources examples` (centralized) | **LOW** (different approach) |
| Field-level docs | `explain resource.field.path` | **Missing** | **MEDIUM** |
| Token cost annotation | Every command annotated | **Missing** | **HIGH** |
| LLM hint annotation | Large commands hint scoping args | **Missing** | **HIGH** |
| Permission annotations | required_scope/role/action on commands | **Missing** | **MEDIUM** |
| Permission-enriched errors | 403 -> "add scope X to your policy" | Generic structured errors only | **MEDIUM** |
| Bundled LLM skills | `skills install` for Claude/Cursor/etc | External only (not in binary) | **LOW** |
| Consistency enforcement | Test: all cmds have token_cost, large have llm_hint | **Missing** | **HIGH** |
| Field discovery (`--json ?`) | **Missing** | Exists | Old CLI gap |
| Agent mode auto-detect | **Missing** | Exists | Old CLI gap |
| Structured error JSON | Basic error strings | `DetailedError` with suggestions | Old CLI gap |

### Recommended Priority for Agentic Features

**P0 -- Must have for agent usability:**
1. **Command annotations**: `token_cost` + `llm_hint` on all commands -- this is the single most impactful feature for agents choosing what to call
2. **Consistency test**: Enforce annotations exist (prevents drift)
3. **`commands` or `help-tree`**: At least one machine-readable command catalog

**P1 -- High value:**
4. **Permission annotations** on commands with error enrichment
5. **`explain`** for field-level schema exploration
6. **`agent-card`** for A2A protocol compliance

**P2 -- Nice to have:**
7. **Bundled skills** (`skills install`)
8. **Tips annotation** on parent commands
9. **`api-resources`** shorthand

---

## Summary: Migration Priority

### P0 -- Critical Gaps (core workflow blockers)
1. **`init` bootstrap flow** -- Users can't onboard without this
2. **Global `--output` / `-o`** -- Consistent output formatting everywhere
3. **`--dry-run --diff`** -- Essential for safe operations
4. **`stacks` management** -- Can't manage stacks at all
5. **`access-policies`** -- Can't manage IAM

### P1 -- High Priority (frequent user workflows)
1. **Alerting**: contact-points, notification-policies, mute-timings, templates
2. **`status`** -- Unified health view (firing alerts + incidents + OnCall)
3. **`diff`** -- Local vs remote comparison
4. **Adaptive metrics/logs/traces** -- Cost optimization
5. **Standalone `metrics/logs/traces` query aliases**
6. **`--upsert` / `--if-not-exists`** -- Idempotent operations
7. **`--jq` filter** -- Output post-processing
8. **Datasource CRUD** (create/update/delete)
9. **Folders dedicated CRUD** with folder-specific flags
10. **`auth status`** -- Token health check

### P2 -- Medium Priority (important but less frequent)
1. Platform: `rbac`, `oauth`, `saml`, `sso-settings`, `scim`
2. Resource: `annotations`, `teams`, `users`, `serviceaccounts`, `plugins`
3. Observability: `recording-rules`, `connections`, `faro`, `integrations`
4. `telemetry` analysis suite (cardinality, pipeline verification)
5. `billing metrics`
6. `audit` (cloud-side resource scanning)
7. Session management (temporary scoped sessions)
8. Verb-first shortcuts (`get/create/update/delete`)
9. CSV and JSONPath output formats
10. Shell completion

### P3 -- Low Priority (nice-to-have)
1. `library-panels`, `playlists`, `snapshots`, `public-dashboards`, `reports`
2. `query-history`, `correlations`, `silences`
3. `cloud-migrations`, `securevalues`, `labels`
4. `assistant` tunnel/auth/agents
5. `app-o11y`, `alloy`, `otlp-endpoint`
6. `agent-card`, `commands`, `help-tree`, `explain`
7. Self-observability (OTLP tracing)
8. Audit logging
9. `usage get/unused`
10. `cloud-provider` (AWS/Azure integrations)
